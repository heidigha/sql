**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous and current role, part of the inital research  when a business problem arises is to disect the current business practices pefromed by the business users.  For example, a user may have created a 30 page excel workbook to measure certain KPIs that requires many hours to maintained with minimal transparency.  User solutions such as this is often deemed inefficient and critized by the technical team -  more often then not - "solution" is sometimes forced onto them with very little communications between the actual business users and the technical team.

In the past, I have little say in this approach of data gathering becuase of my lack of experience and was belived that was the way of fulling my role.   Nowadays, my approach have defintely chagned.   A lot more time is dedicated into to understanding why users perform their tasks they way they do (e.g. lack of technical training/knowledge? corporate red-tape? restraints imposed by managers? or just personal prefences). I am more mindful and will adjust my communication method based on the user's varied backgound, not to be judgemental with their current processes.  More importantly, to work closely with all the stakeholders  (and sometimes compromises) in order to come up a solution.
